            <h1>Eric Meyer</h1>
            <p>Eric A. Meyer has been working with the Web since late 1993 and is an internationally recognized
            expert on the subjects of HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). He is the principal consultant
            for Complex Spiral Consulting and lives in Cleveland, Ohio, which is a much nicer city than you've 
            been led to believe. A graduate of and former Webmaster for Case Western Reserve University and an 
            alumnus of the same fraternity chapter to which Donald Knuth once belonged, Eric coordinated the authoring 
            and creation of the W3C's CSS Test Suite and has recently been acting as List Chaperone of the highly active 
            css-discuss mailing list. Author of "Eric Meyer on CSS" (New Riders), "Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive
            Guide" (O'Reilly & Associates), "CSS2.0 Programmer's Reference" (Osborne/McGraw-Hill), and the fairly well-known
            CSS Browser Compatibility Charts, Eric speaks at a variety of conferences on the subject of standards, CSS use,
            and Web design. For nine years, he was the host of "Your Father's Oldsmobile," a weekly Big Band-era radio show 
            heard on WRUW 91.1-FM in Cleveland.
